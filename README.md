## Preprocessing
The preprocessing step is critical to prepare the email data before it is classified or used for response generation. It involves cleaning, tokenizing, and structuring the email text for NLP tasks.

Data Collection
The synthetic dataset is collected, which includes email-related columns: Sender Name, Recipient

Name, Subject, Email Body, Email Category, Intent, Sentiment, Keywords, and Suggested Response. The data is collected either manually or using an automated script that fetches emails from the Gmail API.

Text Cleaning
The raw email body is cleaned by removing unwanted characters, extra spaces, and formatting issues (e.g., HTML tags, special characters). This ensures the text is ready for tokenization.

Tokenization
After cleaning, the email body is tokenized into words or sub-words to process the text effectively. Tokenization is essential to convert the email text into a format that can be understood by machine learning models.

Stop Word Removal
Common words that don't contribute much meaning (like "and," "the," "is," etc.) are removed to focus on more meaningful words during classification and response generation.
